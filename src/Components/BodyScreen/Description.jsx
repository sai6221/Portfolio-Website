        <p className='descriptionContent'>Dear Geetha,

Thank you for reaching out and considering me for the Statistical Programmer role at IQVIA. I appreciate the opportunity to contribute my skills and expertise to your team. However, upon reviewing the requirements, I noticed that the position calls for a minimum of 5+ years of experience, which exceeds my current experience level as a graduate student at San Jose State University.

While I may not meet the criteria for the Statistical Programmer role, I am genuinely interested in pursuing a career in the fields of AI/ML or data. I would be grateful if you could keep me in mind for any suitable opportunities in these areas that are tailored to candidates with 0-2 years of experience. I am eager to apply my academic knowledge, passion for emerging technologies, and dedication to learning to contribute to a dynamic team.

Please feel free to reach out if there are any relevant positions or if you require any further information from my end. I truly appreciate your consideration, and I hope to have the chance to work together in the future.

Thank you again for your time and assistance.

Kind regards,
</p>
